Qindex is a comprehensive Python system for calculating stock market indices like the DOW or S&P 500. This system will be flexible enough to handle different calculation methodologies, time periods, and stock baskets.

Here's how it works:

### Core Features

- **Flexible Calculation Methods**: Supports multiple index calculation methodologies including:
  - Price-weighted (like DOW Jones)
  - Market-cap weighted (like S&P 500)
  - Equal-weighted
  - Float-adjusted
  - Fundamental-weighted

- **Time Flexibility**: Calculate indices over different time steps (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)

- **Custom Period Selection**: Define your own start and end dates for calculations

- **Current Value Calculation**: Get the latest index value (or for any specific date)

### Key Components

1. `StockIndexCalculator` class - The main engine that:
   - Manages the stock basket 
   - Fetches historical price data via yfinance
   - Calculates indices using different methodologies
   - Handles base values and divisors

2. Helper functions for ease of use:
   - `create_index()` - Create and calculate an index in one step
   - `get_available_methods()` - List available calculation methods
   - `get_available_time_steps()` - List available time steps

### Requirements

The code requires:
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance (for fetching stock data)

### Usage Examples

The code includes examples showing how to:
1. Create a price-weighted tech stock index
2. Create a market-cap weighted index
3. Calculate current index values
4. Plot index values over time
